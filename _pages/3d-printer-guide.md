<h2>3D Printing using Orca Slicer (software app) and the Anycubic Kobra 3 Printer (hardware)</h2>

<p>The slicing software creates instructions for how to print an object for a particular printer. On the Mac workstations in the History Tech Lab, the software is set to default to the printer we have: the Anycubic Kobra 3. You can choose which of the four loaded filaments you want to use for your print. Watch these videos for helpful step-by-step tutorials.</p>

<h2>Tips and Screenshots</h2>
Open the Orca Slicer application and import an STL file. After rotating it and snapping it to the build plate, it should look like what you see in this image.

Adjust the dimensions and any other print settings. Then click 'Sice plate' at the top of the screen.<br>
Make sure that the file is saved in the file type '.gcode' and after the slicing completes it should look like this image.
